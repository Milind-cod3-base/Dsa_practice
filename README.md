# Data structures and Algorithms practice

## What
This repo is for keeping files of daily practice of data structures and algorithms.

## Why
This repo helps me keep in touch with basics of algorithms by regular practice

## How
After reading theory from "The Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven S. Skiena, I try to implement algorithms and data structures in python. If I fail, I try to look up answer on internet to optimize my code, hence helping and reinforcing my practice.
